#Frequency

Design and implement an application that reads an arbitrary number of integers that are in the range 0 to 50 inclusive and counts how many occurrences of each are entered. After all input has been processed, print all of the values (with the number of occurrences) that were entered one or more times. The output should be one frequency count per line with the following format:

3 occurrences of 2
7 occurrences of 5

Name your application class Frequency
